  title: 01 Design Goals,
  content: "Venmo is a peer-to-peer payment platform that allows users to pay and receive money within their networks for any reason. Venmo has about 27 million users. 66% of young Americans that use payment platforms use Venmo. In the Q2 of 2018, Venmo did over $14 billion in transaction Volume. It became so popular that the the top 8 banks in the US banded together to create a competitor called Zelle.<br><br>
           Although Venmo remains popular, through personal experiences with the application and user research from its user demographics, we learned that there are some key design issues that need to be addressed for Venmo if it wants to remain as the top payment transfer platform. Compared to its competitors, it is lacking in many features and gives a relatively poor user experience. Through our redesign, we provide solutions to many of these issues."

user-research: {
  title: 02 User Research / Problems,
  content: "<span class='emphasize'>85%</span> of users are not aware of the option to add multiple people in an equal amount transaction.<br>
    <span class='emphasize'>75%</span> of users said they wanted to be able to pay or request immediately upon opening the app without seeing a social feed.<br>
    <span class='emphasize'>65%</span> said they frequently struggled with some aspect of paying or requesting whether that had to do with calculations of payment, completing multiple transactions, or fear of selecting the wrong user.<br>
    <span class='emphasize'>68%</span> said they didn’t like that when completing a request that’s higher than their current Venmo balance, they’re unable to use their Venmo balance first, then pay the rest with their card.<br>
    <span class='emphasize'>50%</span> of users said they sometimes looked at the feed but agreed it was NOT a high priority for them. The other percentages seldom or never looked at the feed.<br><br>
    The top use cases for using Venmo was eating out with friends, travel expenses, paying house expenses, such as rent, utilities, and groceries. The top substitutes for Venmo were Zelle and Paypal."
